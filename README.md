# Fake Datasets with Python Faker Library

This project demonstrates the generation of fake datasets using the Python Faker library. It includes three different types of datasets: employee records, car park, and invoice. The datasets are entirely fictional and are intended for demonstration and testing purposes only.

## Datasets

1. Employee Records Dataset
2. Car Park Dataset
3. Invoice Dataset

## Python Scripts

1. employee_records.py - Generates the employee records dataset.
2. car_park.py - Generates the car park dataset.
3. invoice.py - Generates the invoice dataset.

## Sample Dataset Outputs (CSV format)

1. employee_records_sample.csv - A sample employee records dataset output.
2. car_park_sample.csv - A sample car park dataset output.
3. invoice_sample.csv - A sample invoice dataset output.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install Faker


2. Run the desired script to generate a dataset:

python employee_records.py
python car_park.py
python invoice.py


3. The output datasets will be saved in the current working directory as CSV files.

## Note

These datasets are entirely fictional and should not be used for any decision-making or analysis. They are suitable for demonstration, testing, or educational purposes only.
